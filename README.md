### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jon, and I am a transitioning Army veteran looking to enter into tech. I've spent the last year working to learn new tools, languages, and frameworks with the intent of becoming a Software Engineer, bridging the gap between my degree in Computer Engineering and my professional experience as an Infantry Officer.

Most of my work has utilized the following technologies as I learn the fundamentals and idioms of software design:
- Go
- React/Next.js and React Native
- Python
- Typescript
- C/C++
- Postman
- SQL
- AWS/GCP
